Running and writing tests
=========================

Running
------
Use ```ctest``` or ```make test``` within the build folder to run all tests.

- ```mpirun -np 4 ./build/testprecice -x``` runs boost test with colored output.
- ```mpirun -np 4 ./build/testprecice -x -r detailed -t "+/+PetRadial+"``` (replace all + by *, due to Doxygen) runs all ```PetRadial*``` tests from all test suites using colored output and detailed reporting.

Writing unit tests
------------------
To learn, how to write new tests, have a look at ```./src/mapping/tests/PetRadialBasisFctMappingTest.cpp```.

```
#include "testing/Testing.hpp" // Include that for some basic stuff

// Properly sort your tests into the test tree
BOOST_AUTO_TEST_SUITE(MappingTests)
BOOST_AUTO_TEST_SUITE(PetRadialBasisFunctionMapping)

BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE(ConsistentNonIncremental) // A standard test case, runs on all ranks
{
  // Always use BOOST_TEST. If you check for boolean, BOOST_CHECK is also ok
  BOOST_TEST(outValuesScalar(0) == inValuesScalar(0));

  // Use testing::equals instead of math::equals. It prints the operands on failure
  BOOST_TEST( testing::equals(values, Eigen::Vector4d(0.0, 2.0, 0.0, 1.0), tolerance) );
}

// That test cases only runs on master (rank == 0) and uses a lower floating point precision for BOOST_CHECK
BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE(PolynomialSwitch,
                     * testing::OnMaster()
                     * boost::unit_test::tolerance(1e-6))
{...}

// That test case runs on ranks 0, 1, 2 and 3.
BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE(DistributedConsistent2DV2,
                     * testing::OnRanks({0, 1, 2, 3}))
{...}

// Close your test suites
BOOST_AUTO_TEST_SUITE_END()
BOOST_AUTO_TEST_SUITE_END()
```

FAQ
---
- **How can I setup/tearDown a test case?** Use [fixtures](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_65_1/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/tests_organization/fixtures.html) and attach them to a test suite or case
- **How to configure logging for the tests?** Use a file ```log.conf``` as described in [Logging](https://www.precice.org/configuration-logging.html).

Writing integration tests
-------------------------
If you are writing a new integration tests, the basic procedure is similar to the one for unit tests. There are the following important differences:

- the preCICE integration tests are located under ```./tests```
- each test goes into an individual ```.cpp``` file.
- suites are organized in folder hierarchies within ```./tests```
- common functionality in a suite may be provided in a ```helpers.cpp``` file

Please use the script [createTest.py](https://github.com/precice/precice/blob/develop/tools/building/createTest.py) for the generation of a skeleton for a new test. It will take care of setting everything up in the required format.
As an example, refer to existing integration tests in `./tests`.
