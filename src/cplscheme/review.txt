Questions and todos before merging the i10 branch back to master

- ImplicitCouplingScheme
	- Is the ImplicitCouplingScheme an abstract class?
  	  --> If yes, adapt documentation.  
	--> Adapt some documentation (methods have /** */ doc)
	- Do all methods work for Serial and ParallelI.C.?
  	  --> If not, adapt.  
	--> Refactor protected member variables.

- SerialImplicitCouplingScheme
	--> Adapt documentation in SerialImplicitCouplingScheme
	- How has initializeData() been changed/written now?
  
- ParallelImplicitCouplingScheme
	- How does mergeData() work? Does it "copy" data?
