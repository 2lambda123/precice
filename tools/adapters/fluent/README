How to build the Fluent-preCICE adapter:

1. Create a directory lnamd64/2ddp/ for serial execution
   and for parallel execution add a /2ddp_host/ and /2ddp_node/.
2. put the libraries of preCICE and python2.7 into the lnamd64 folder.
3. Type: make "FLUENT_ARCH=lnamd64" to start the build. Add a "clean" to clean it.
4. Copy the lnamd64 folder into, e.g., a libudf folder where fluent is run.

Preparing a Fluent .cas file for FSI simulations:

- Hook the UDF, e.g., by manage
- Define one user defined memory for the faces
- Set a user defined mesh motion according to function "gridmotions" 

Preparing the preCICE XML configuration:
- The number of valid digits for the timestep length needs to be 8, since fluent
  has only a single precision timestep length. Set this in the tag <timestep-length ... valid-digits="8"/>
