Analysis of existing CAD and Meshing Tools:

Ideas:
	* 2D line-segment meshes can be easily refined
	* 3D polygon surface meshes can be easily refined
	* a parser could be written by ourselves

	

Data formats:
------------

STEP:
   + the most modern CAD data exchange standard
   - complex
   ? suited for triangulations
   
IGES:
   + another (older) CAD data exchange standard
   - complex
   ? suitable for triangulations

VRML:
   + import/export implemented in most CAD and modelling software
   + extendable by additional classes
   + OpenCASCADE can export it
   - own textual format
   - outdated by X3D
   
X3D:
   + follower of VRML
   + more powerful than VRML
   - not very widespread
   
STL:
   + import/export implemented in most CAD and modelling software
   + simple format
   + OpenCASCADE can export it
   - not extendable
   - triangles only 


CAD Programs investigated:
---------------------------------

Netgen:
	+ Freeware
	+ Windows and Linux compatible
	+ IGES, STEP
	- only 3D
	- only tetrahedral meshing

Rhino:
	+ sophisticated modelling
	+ cheap single user version (195$), moderate lab version (~1000$)
	+ STEP, IGES, .......
	+ supports creation of polygon meshes and export to parasolid
	- only 3D modeling and meshing
	- only forWindows
	- commercial, only trial version is free (saves 25 times)

Vectorworks:
	+ dongle to use multiple installations (sequentially) with single user license
	+ free student version (not compatible with non-free version)
	+ IGES, ....
	- only for Windows and Mac
	- workstation bound licence (free-one)
	
Comsol:
	+ is able to import, (export?) parasolid format from version 3.5 on
	+ can export dxf 2D geometries 
	+ we do have version 3.5
	- does only write out the geometry, not the mesh 
	 
Blender:
   + freeware
   + very powerful
   - cannot read/write IGES or STEP
   - not very intuitive to use 
	 
CAD data parsers:
--------------------------

openCASCADE:
	+ free
	+ converts IGES and STEP to OpenCASCADE internal format
	- no free DXF converter
	  
No other free parsers have been found so far. It is essential that the parsers are free
software, because the parser will be packed into preCICE.
