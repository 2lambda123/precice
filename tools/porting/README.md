# Porting Tools

## Porting configuration from version 2 to version 3

The tool `precice-2-to-3` ports a configuration file of precice version 2 to version 3.
It requires python 3.6 and the python package `lxml` to be installed on the system.

You may still need to adjust the resulting configuration file, thus it is highly recommended to read the porting guide.
